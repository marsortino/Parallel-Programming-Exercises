Suppose to have n spheres scattered in the space.
Given a point in the space P (e.g. (0,0,0)), for each sphere compute the segment starting from the center of the sphere and having end in P.
For each segment compute the intersection with each sphere and the lenght of it.


To run all the codes and make an average run the script:
$ bash results.sh

The average results will be printed in results.txt, a log of each run time is stored in log_results.txt
