Suppose to toss darts randomly at a 2 x 2 feet squared cardboard. In the cardboard there is inscribed a 1 feet radius circle. Considering the darts to be throwed in a uniformed distribution, the number of darts in circle wrt the total number of tosses should be pi/4.

Compute pi/4 considering a Monte Carlo method and using openMP.
